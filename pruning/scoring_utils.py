GraphRAG Pruning Lab - Scoring Utilities (High-Level Framework)

This module provides the framework for scoring nodes, edges, and communities.
You can implement your own scoring algorithms here.

Framework Structure:
- GraphScorer: Main class for coordinating scoring
- Individual scoring methods: degree, frequency, semantic, etc.
- Combined scoring: Weighted combination of multiple metrics
- Data loading: Load GraphRAG artifacts from parquet files
